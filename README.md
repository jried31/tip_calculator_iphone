# tip_calculator_iphone
This is a demo of a tip calculator for an iPhone. This project enables the user to calculate tip percentages given a bill total. The algorithm accounts for local, currency type, and various tip percentages. This project also implements UI transitions+theme changes. 

FYI: Per Tim's recommendation, this is submited for consideration for the developer track. 

Time spent: 4 hours in total

Completed user stories:
[X] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
[X] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
[X] Optional: UI animations
[X] Optional: Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
[X] Optional: Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
[X] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
